How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to compare old files with new ones, and restore it if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In manual commit I can control when to save and what size of data.
	but in automatic version it may save somethings that is not important
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becuase Git is for projects control, while others are not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
	
	git diff original newCommit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Very much since I can go back to any working version if the current version had bugs
